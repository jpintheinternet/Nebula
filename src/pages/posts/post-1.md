# My First Nebula Post

Published on: 2023-12-29

Welcome to my _nebula blog_ about learning Astro and celestial events! Here, I will journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages be creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
